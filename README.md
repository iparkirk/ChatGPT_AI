#### **Stage 1: Fundamentals with MNIST**

*   **Objective:** Practice core architectures using simple datasets like MNIST for a strong mathematical and architectural foundation.
*   **Focus:** Implement algorithms (VAE, GAN, Diffusion, LLM) with minimal domain-specific complexities.

#### **Stage 2: Transition to Chemistry**

*   **Objective:** Apply architectures to chemistry data (sequences and graphs), starting with SMILES and progressing to molecular graphs.
*   **Focus:** Address challenges like ensuring chemical validity and incorporating domain-specific constraints.

#### **Stage 3: Transition to Biology**

*   **Objective:** Extend architectures to biology data (protein sequences and 3D structures), addressing increased complexity.
*   **Focus:** Model biological plausibility, such as protein folding and functional motifs.
